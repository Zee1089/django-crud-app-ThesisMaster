# MindM-app

    MindM-app is an app to help you organize and manage your research work. When you are in school and maybe doing research for the first time, mindM-app allows you: to access your notes quickly, store your papers and streamline you workflow; and in the future even collaborate with research mates.

The reason I built MindMapp is that managing research can be stressful, especially when you're submerged under a mountain of research papers. I wanted a tool that would allow you to seamlessly jump from one paper to the next or have all your papers neatly formatted on one page with important notes easily accessible. I believe this kind of organization can significantly reduce stress and make the research process more enjoyable. I wish I had something like this earlier in my academic journey! MindMapp is designed to benefit students, researchers, and anyone working with large amounts of information.


## Get Started:

[MindM-app](https://mindmapp-3959f04c661f.herokuapp.com/)

## Attribution

- **SVG Icons**: Icons used in this project are sourced from [SVG Repo](https://www.svgrepo.com/).

- **App Inspiration**: Some aspects of this application were inspired by the "Cat Collector" CRUD app developed during the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive program.

- **Assistance**: Some guidance and code suggestions were provided by ChatGPT, a language model created by OpenAI, which was used as a tool to sometimes refine css and troubleshoot code.

## Technologies Used:


**Python**: Language for Backend.

**Django**'s templates for rendering templates to users. Django's built-in session-based authentication.

**PostgreSQL**: Relational database management system used to store research data securely.

**HTML, CSS Flexbox and JavaScript**: used to create interactive and user friendly interface for Frontend technologies.

**Heroku**: Cloud platform used for deployment, making MindMapp accessible online. 

> **Git and Github**:  Version control system used for source code management


#### 3. Next Steps:
- **Build a Built-in Notebook**: Integrate a notebook directly into MindMapp, allowing users to write and organize their thesis. This feature will enable users to keep everything in one place, streamlining the writing process and ensuring all research components remain connected within the app.

- **Build a Community Page**: Create a community page for researchers to collaborate, share progress, notes, and papers. To create an efficiently and seamless working environment.
